# Web Application Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing

This project is focused on understanding the importance of developing a secured website by creating two similar websites, one secured and one vulnerable. The purpose of this project is to conduct a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on the vulnerable website, identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities such as SQL login bypass and reflected XSS, and developing the secured website with appropriate security measures to overcome these vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- JavaScript
- XAMPP (Apache and MySQL servers)

## Running the Project

To run the websites, follow the steps below:

1. Install XAMPP on your machine.
2. Start the Apache and MySQL servers in XAMPP.
3. Download or clone the project from the GitHub repository.
4. Extract the files from the downloaded zip.
5. Copy the extracted files to the htdocs folder in XAMPP installation directory.
6. Open a web browser and go to the following URLs:
   - For the vulnerable website: `http://localhost/vulnerable_website`
   - For the secured website: `http://localhost/secured_website`
