<h1>Social Engineering</h1>
<h2>Does Human behavior can be exploited??</h2>
<p>Social Engineering is an art of exploiting Human psychology, rather than technical hacking techniques to gain access to domains, systems or data. 
</p>

<p>Social engineering is the act of tricking someone into divulging information or taking action, usually through technology. The idea behind social engineering is to take advantage of a potential victim’s natural tendencies and emotional reactions.
    To access a computer network, the typical hacker might look for a software vulnerability. A social engineer, though, could pose as a technical support person to trick an employee into divulging their login credentials. The fraudster is hoping to appeal to the employee’s desire to help a colleague and, perhaps, act first and think later.  </p>
<h2>Types of attacks</h2>
<h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.<br><br><h3>Example:</h3>When someones calls you on phone or sends you emails or messages and tells you that we are calling from your bank, your login credentials has been compromised so please give your login credentials, we will update and secure and your account...This is one of the example of phishing attack.</p>

<h2>Baiting</h2>
<p>As its name implies, baiting attacks use a false promise to pique a victim's greed or curiosity. They lure users into a trap that steals their personal information or inflicts their systems with malware. The most reviled form of baiting uses physical media to disperse malware.<br><br><h3>Example:</h3> When some random person ask you to install something to his pendrive or Trapping the victim by placing a pendrive in his visible sight which seems to be lost by someone, and when the victim pick that drive and tries to access his system then the complete system will be compromised. These are the examples of Baiting. </p>

<h2>Malware</h2>
<p>Malware is a catch-all term for any type of malicious software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device, service or network. Cybercriminals typically use it to extract data that they can leverage over victims for financial gain.<br><br><h3>Example: </h3>When we are installing something on google suddenly a popup message will be displayed threatening us that our phone is affected to virus so please install respective software to keep our system secure where the malware is present in the software...</p>

<h2>Pretexting</h2>
<p>Pretexting is a form of social engineering in which an individual lies to obtain privileged data. A pretext is a false motive.Pretexting often involves a scam where the liar pretends to need information in order to confirm the identity of the person he is talking to. After establishing trust with the targeted individual, the pretexter might ask a series of questions designed to gather key individual identifiers such as confirmation of the individual's social security number, mother's maiden name, place or date of birth or account number.<br><br> <h3>Example: </h3>When someone calls you and says that they are calling from some xyz company and collecting information from us by confirming that is it your name? They keep on prolonging the call and collects information from us without our senses which is known as pretexting.</p>

<h2>Tailgating</h2>
<p>An attacker seeking entry to a restricted area, where access is unattended or controlled by electronic access control.  If your organization has more than one door or perhaps a secondary exit to the parking lot. Make sure that no one is allowed in through those doors (except the authorized personnel) – this is a tailgating attack.<br><br><h3>Example: </h3>Frequently we observe that at some companies or industries we find some people enter into the company behind some person who has permission. When person place his id he gets his access and the doors will be opened at the time the exploiters will be following him and enter the company before the door closes. So they enters the place where they has no access and starts collecting data they want inside the company.</p>

<h2>Water Holing</h2>
<p>A water-holing (or sometimes watering hole) attack is where a mal-actor attempts to compromise a specific group of people by infecting one or more websites that they are known to visit. The victims are usually from the same company or organisation and the goal is usually to gain access to that organisation’s computer network by infecting one or more users’ computers with malware.<br><br><h3>Example: </h3>We listen that some company data is breached to malware effects which caused due to one of the employee who have lack of awareness. The exploiter select one employee in the company and compromise his system as he has lack of awareness, so he can be exploited. By compromising the system the attacker places a malware which infect all the systems in the company which leads to breach. When the target is one company it is done by using one of the person in the company such that the whole company will be exploited before they identify it.</p>
